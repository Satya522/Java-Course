## Exception Handling in Java
 An exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of instructions.

An exception can occur for many reasons. some of them are:
- A user has entered invalid data.
- A file that needs to be opened cannot be found.
- A network connection has been lost in the middle of communications or the JVM has run out of memory.
- These exceptions are caused by user error, programmer error, or physical resources that have failed.
- When an exception occurs, the normal flow of the program is disrupted and the program/Application terminates abnormally, which is not recommended.
