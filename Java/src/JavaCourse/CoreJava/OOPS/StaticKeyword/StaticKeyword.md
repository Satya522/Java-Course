_Here is a detailed explanation of the `static` keyword in Java suitable for a company-level documentation file:

# Static Keyword in Java

The `static` keyword in Java is a non-access modifier used for methods and attributes. It is used to create class-level variables and methods that can be accessed without creating an instance of the class.

## Static Data Members

- **Definition**: Static data members, also known as class variables, are variables declared with the `static` keyword.
- **Characteristics**:
    - Common to all objects of the class.
    - Initialized only once at the start of the execution.
    - Created when the program starts and destroyed when the program stops.
    - Accessed using the class name rather than the object name.
- **Usage**: Used to refer to the common property of all objects (not unique for each object).

### Example
```java
public class Example {
    static int count = 0; // static data member

    public Example() {
        count++;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Example obj1 = new Example();
        Example obj2 = new Example();
        System.out.println("Count: " + Example.count); // Accessing static data member
    }
}
```

## Static Methods

- **Definition**: Static methods are methods declared with the `static` keyword.
- **Characteristics**:
    - Can be called without creating an instance of the class.
    - Can access static data members and can change their values.
    - Cannot access instance variables or instance methods directly.
- **Usage**: Used for operations that do not require data from an instance of the class.

### Example
```java
public class Example {
    static int count = 0;

    public static void incrementCount() { // static method
        count++;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Example.incrementCount(); // Calling static method
        System.out.println("Count: " + Example.count);
    }
}
```

## Static Blocks

- **Definition**: Static blocks are blocks of code that are executed when the class is loaded into memory.
- **Characteristics**:
    - Used to initialize static data members.
    - Executed before the main method and before any object is created.
- **Usage**: Used for static initialization of data.

### Example
```java
public class Example {
    static int count;

    static { // static block
        count = 10;
        System.out.println("Static block executed.");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Count: " + Example.count);
    }
}
```

## Static Classes

- **Definition**: Static classes are nested classes declared with the `static` keyword.
- **Characteristics**:
    - Can be used only within the outer class.
    - Cannot access non-static members of the outer class directly.
- **Usage**: Used to group classes that are only used in one place, increasing encapsulation.

### Example
```java
public class OuterClass {
    static class NestedStaticClass {
        public void display() {
            System.out.println("Static nested class method.");
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        OuterClass.NestedStaticClass nested = new OuterClass.NestedStaticClass();
        nested.display();
    }
}
```

## Summary

The `static` keyword in Java is a powerful tool for creating class-level variables and methods, initializing data, and defining nested classes. It helps in memory management and provides a way to access members without creating an instance of the class.

### Static Variables

Static variables are shared among all instances of a class.

```java
public class StaticVariableExample {
    static int counter = 0;

    public StaticVariableExample() {
        counter++;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        StaticVariableExample obj1 = new StaticVariableExample();
        StaticVariableExample obj2 = new StaticVariableExample();
        StaticVariableExample obj3 = new StaticVariableExample();
        System.out.println("Counter: " + StaticVariableExample.counter); // Output: Counter: 3
    }
}
```

### Static Methods

Static methods can be called without creating an instance of the class.

```java
public class StaticMethodExample {
    static void displayMessage() {
        System.out.println("Hello, this is a static method.");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        StaticMethodExample.displayMessage(); // Calling static method
    }
}
```

### Static Blocks

Static blocks are used for static initialization of a class.

```java
public class StaticBlockExample {
    static int num;
    static String str;

    static {
        num = 42;
        str = "Hello, World!";
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Number: " + StaticBlockExample.num); // Output: Number: 42
        System.out.println("String: " + StaticBlockExample.str); // Output: String: Hello, World!
    }
}
```

### Static Nested Classes

Static nested classes can be used to logically group classes that are only used in one place.

```java
public class OuterClass {
    static class StaticNestedClass {
        void display() {
            System.out.println("This is a static nested class.");
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        OuterClass.StaticNestedClass nested = new OuterClass.StaticNestedClass();
        nested.display(); // Output: This is a static nested class.
    }
}
```

### Static Import

Static import allows you to access static members of a class directly without class qualification.

```java
import static java.lang.Math.*;

public class StaticImportExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Square root of 16: " + sqrt(16)); // Output: Square root of 16: 4.0
        System.out.println("PI value: " + PI); // Output: PI value: 3.141592653589793
    }
}
```

These examples illustrate various uses of the `static` keyword in Java, including static variables, methods, blocks, nested classes, and static import.


## Key differences between static and instance members in Java:

### Static Members

1. **Definition**: Declared with the `static` keyword.
2. **Scope**: Belong to the class itself rather than any instance of the class.
3. **Access**: Can be accessed using the class name directly.
4. **Memory Allocation**: Allocated memory only once when the class is loaded.
5. **Usage**: Used for common properties or methods shared among all instances.
6. **Example**:
    ```java
    public class Example {
        static int staticVar = 10; // static variable

        static void staticMethod() { // static method
            System.out.println("Static method called.");
        }
    }

    public class Main {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            System.out.println(Example.staticVar); // Accessing static variable
            Example.staticMethod(); // Calling static method
        }
    }
    ```

### Instance Members

1. **Definition**: Declared without the `static` keyword.
2. **Scope**: Belong to a specific instance of the class.
3. **Access**: Accessed using an object of the class.
4. **Memory Allocation**: Allocated memory each time an instance of the class is created.
5. **Usage**: Used for properties or methods that vary from one instance to another.
6. **Example**:
    ```java
    public class Example {
        int instanceVar = 20; // instance variable

        void instanceMethod() { // instance method
            System.out.println("Instance method called.");
        }
    }

    public class Main {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            Example obj = new Example();
            System.out.println(obj.instanceVar); // Accessing instance variable
            obj.instanceMethod(); // Calling instance method
        }
    }
    ```

### Summary

- **Static Members**: Shared among all instances, accessed using the class name, and initialized once.
- **Instance Members**: Unique to each instance, accessed using an object, and initialized with each object creation.
- 
###  Static members in Java have a significant impact on memory management. Here are the key points:

### Static Variables
- **Memory Allocation**: Static variables are allocated memory only once when the class is loaded into memory by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). This memory is allocated in the method area (part of the heap).
- **Lifetime**: They exist for the entire duration of the program. They are created when the class is loaded and destroyed when the class is unloaded.
- **Shared Among Instances**: Static variables are shared among all instances of the class. This means that all instances access the same memory location for the static variable, which can save memory when the same value is used across multiple instances.

### Static Methods
- **Memory Allocation**: Static methods are also loaded into memory when the class is loaded. They do not require an instance of the class to be invoked.
- **Efficiency**: Since static methods do not operate on instance data, they can be more efficient in terms of memory usage and performance. They are typically used for utility or helper methods that perform operations not dependent on instance variables.

### **Static Blocks**
- **Initialization**: Static blocks are used to initialize static variables. They are executed once when the class is loaded into memory, ensuring that static variables are initialized before they are accessed.

### **Static Classes**
- **Nested Classes**: Static nested classes do not hold a reference to an instance of the outer class. This can reduce memory overhead when the nested class does not need to access instance members of the outer class.

### Summary
- **Memory Efficiency**: Static members help in reducing memory usage by sharing common data among all instances and avoiding the need for instance-specific data when not necessary.
- **Lifecycle Management**: Static members have a lifecycle tied to the class rather than individual instances, which can simplify memory management and improve performance.

By understanding and utilizing static members appropriately, developers can optimize memory usage and improve the efficiency of their Java applications._
