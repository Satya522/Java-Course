/*
Bits are the smallest unit of data in a computer. They are either 0 or 1.
The number of bits in a data type is fixed, for example, 32 bits for an integer.

 ================== Bit Manipulation ==================

Bit manipulation is the act of algorithmically manipulating bits or binary digits.
Computers store data in binary format, which is a sequence of 0s and 1s.
Bit manipulation is used to perform operations at the bit level.

Bit manipulation is a technique where we use bitwise operators to manipulate bit patterns of integers.
Bit manipulation can be used to find the number of bits needed to represent an integer in binary form, to set or clear bits, to toggle bits, to check if a bit is set, and so on.

Types of Bitwise Operators:
1. AND (&): It returns 1 if both bits are 1, otherwise 0.
2. OR (|): It returns 1 if at least one bit is 1, otherwise 0.
3. XOR (^): It returns 1 if the bits are different, otherwise 0.
4. NOT (~): It returns the complement of a number.
5. Left Shift (<<): It shifts the bits to the left by a specified number of positions.
6. Right Shift (>>): It shifts the bits to the right by a specified number of positions.
7. Zero-fill Right Shift (>>>): It shifts the bits to the right by a specified number of positions, and fills the leftmost bits with 0s.

Bitwise operators are faster than arithmetic operators because they directly operate on bits.

Advantages of Bit Manipulation:
1. Bit manipulation is faster than arithmetic operations.
2. Bit manipulation can be used to perform operations at the bit level.
3. Bit manipulation can be used to optimize algorithms.

Applications of Bit Manipulation:
1. Bit manipulation is used in low-level programming, such as device drivers, operating systems, and embedded systems.
2. Bit manipulation is used in cryptography to encrypt and decrypt data.
3. Bit manipulation is used in networking to encode and decode data.
4. Bit manipulation is used in graphics to perform image processing.
5. Bit manipulation is used in compression algorithms to reduce the size of data.
6. Bit manipulation is used in database management to store and retrieve data.
7. Bit manipulation is used in artificial intelligence to perform logical operations.
8. Bit manipulation is used in computer graphics to render images.
9. Bit manipulation is used in computer vision to process images and videos.
10. Bit manipulation is used in machine learning to optimize algorithms.
