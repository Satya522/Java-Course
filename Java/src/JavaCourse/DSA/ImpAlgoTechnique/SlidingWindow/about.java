      The sliding window technique is a method that allows us to calculate a property (like a sum, a product, a
      minimum, etc.) of a subset of a list or array of values. This subset is typically contiguous in the array and
      its size varies based on the problem at hand. The subset is referred to as a "window" and as we move through
      the array, we "slide" this window over the elements.

      Here's a step-by-step explanation of how the sliding window technique works:

     1. Initialize a window with a start and end pointer, both at the beginning of the array. The window size can be
     fixed or variable depending on the problem.

     2. Move the end pointer to the right, expanding the window until the window's property meets the condition.

     3. Once the condition is met, we can record the result (if needed) and then start moving the start pointer to the
     right (shrinking the window) until the window's property no longer meets the condition.

     4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the end pointer has scanned through the entire array.

     This technique is particularly useful when dealing with arrays or lists where you're looking for contiguous
     segments that satisfy certain constraints. It's often used in problems related to string or array manipulation, and can help reduce time complexity from O(n^2) to O(n) in many cases.
